# Creating a Facebook App

## Create the App

I followed this guide.

[Automatically publish to facebook pages with python](https://blog.theodo.com/2019/02/automatically-publish-facebook-pages-python/)

## App Review

Facebook has suspended individual verification because of COVID. Business verification is required. If you are like me and creating a not-for-profit page to share information, it's still valuable to have a business.

The following steps are obviously only for the USA. It will be required to create a business to publish a facebook app, until they bring back individual verification.

The rest of the information required for completing app review should be found here:

[Server-to-Server Apps](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/server-to-server-apps) 
> If your app has no user interface because it exchanges data directly with our APIs, refer to this guide when configuring your app's Basic Settings, and when completing App Review.

## Business Verification

### Sole Proprietorship

Simplest cheapest way to register a business, can change this later if necessary.

[50 State Guide to Establishing a Sole Proprietorship](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/50-state-guide-establishing-sole-proprietorship.html)

for my state, this will cost only $40.

### EIN (optional)

Also useful will be to apply for EIN. This way you can open a bank account under the business name.
