# Marshall Rosenberg Quote-bot

You need to adapt the [workflow file](/.github/workflows/quote.yml) to run this elsewhere.

Every 4 hours, a Marshall Rosenberg quote is tweeted out by [@MarshallRsnberg](https://twitter.com/MarshallRsnberg).

I followed adapted the script found in [this guide](https://dototot.com/how-to-write-a-twitter-bot-with-python-and-tweepy/), and saved the secrets for the Marshall Rosenberg Quotes account as encrypted environment variables in this repository, which are pulled into a bash shell as part of the action, and then called into the python script.

as time goes on I'll be adding links from this repository into the [quotes list](quotes.yaml), and harvest quotes from other sources, so Marshall's quotebot has plenty to share.

This message is too valuable for it to not be shared.
